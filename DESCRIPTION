Version: 1.5.1
Author: Avinash R. Shenoy
Maintainer: Avinash Shenoy <a.shenoy@imperial.ac.uk>
Description: Easily plot many types of graphs with few lines of code as compared to `ggplot2`. Options include scatter or dotplots and boxes, violins or SD error bars to depict dispersion, factorial ANOVAs, before-after plots, QQ plots and more. Choose from 8 colour-blind friendly discreet or 1 continuous colour scheme. Includes simple code to perform ANOVA analyses using ordinary (`lm`) or mixed-effects linear models (`lme4`) for randomised-block or repeated-measures designs. You can then carry out post-hoc comparisons of interest (`emmeans`). Also includes practice datasets for plotting graphs and performing analyses.
