# grafify v1.5.1

This update fixes and cleans up code to remove all errors, warnings and notes from `devtools::check()`. All previous code should still work. 

 a. The main update is that `broom.mixed::augment` is used to get model residuals than the `fortify` method as this will be deprecated soon. The `broom.mixed` package therefore required. 
 b. The way ANOVA table is generated no longer relies on an internal function from `lmerTest`, but instead forces a mixed model object as `lmerModLmerTest` object to get F and P values in ANOVA tables from the `stats::anova` call.
 c. The `magrittr` package is required for internal use of pipes (`%>%`).
 d. Much of the code for `simple_model` and `mixed_model` was cleaned up so that model outputs are as close to objects generated by native calls to `lm` or `lmer`.
 e. Several internal functions related to the colour palettes have now been exported as this was easier.
 f. The `make_1w_rb_data` and `make_2w_rb_data` functions have been updated to have consistent factor and level names.

# grafify v1.5.0

## Major fixes 

1. New graph types

This version has 8 new `plot_` functions ending in `_sc` for plotting data with two variables wherein the X variable is plotted in a single colour. This contrasts existing versions that plot the X variable with multiple colours chosen from the `all_grafify` palette. This is convenient when there are too many groups on the X axis and multiple colours are not necessary.

2. Plotting Q-Q plot of model residuals

`plot_qqmodel` will plot a diagnostic Q-Q plot of a simple linear model (generated with `simple_model` or `lm`) or mixed effects linear model (generated with `mixed_model` or `lmer`) in a single step.

## Minor fixes

Fixed a typo in `posthoc_Levelwise` where the `adjust` argument wasn not being correctly passed on to `emmeans`.


# grafify v1.4.1

This version "breaks" a few arguments from v0.3.1, therefore is v1.4.1. Specifically, opacity for both symbols and bars/boxes/violins can be set using `s_alpha` and `b_alpha` or `v_alpha`, respectively; previously, only bars/boxes/violin opacity could be set with a single `alpha` parameter. Old code with just `alpha` will no longer work, sorry! There are also new graph types and arguments for ANOVAs as below.

## Major fixes 

1. New graph types
   
    a. `plot_density` and `plot_histogram` for smooth density or histogram plots through `geom_density` and `geom_histogram` respectively.
    b. two new plot types `plot_scatterbox` and `plot_scatterviolin` that complement the `plot_dot...` versions and instead use `geom_point` with `position_jitter`. These versions are useful when a large number of data points are needed to be plotted.
    
1. Updates 

      a. `simple_anova` where the table also has Mean SS.
      b. `mixed_anova` now has two new arguments, one to change method for Df calculation and second to get type I or III SS (default is type II).
      c. `jitter` argument added to `plot_3d..` and `plot_4d..` functions for consistency with other scatter plots.
      d. `bwid` argument (for adjusting width of bars) added to `plot_scatterbar_sd` for consistency.

# grafify v0.3.1

Bug fixes in `mixed_model` and `simple_model` which now correctly lists the data used in the call field. 

# grafify v0.3.0

1. A new `plot_4d_scatterbar` function which is like `plot_4d_scatterbox` but plots bar and SD. So there are now two `plot_3d_` and `plot_4d_` functions.
2. Text on X-axis on all graphs can be rotated from 0-90 using `TextXAngle` argument to prevent overlap. 
3. `plot_dot_` functions now have `dotthick` option to set stroke thickness. This is similar to `symthick` for scatter/jitter plots.
4. Using `facet_wrap` or `facet_grid` will not draw a box around panel text (unlike the default in `theme_classic()`).
5. `plot_3d_` and `plot_4d_` functions draw symbols in black colour. 

# grafify v0.2.1:

1. Bug fixes in `plot_3d_scatterbar` and `plot_3d_scatterbox`, which now correctly use the "shapes" variable to fill colour of bars/boxes and shape of the symbols; symbols are depicted in black.
2. `simple_anova` generates type II ANOVA table through `car::Anova()`, so the `car` package is now a dependency. v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 generated type I ANOVA table through `stats::anova()`. 

# grafify v0.2.0:

1. the main difference from v0.1.0 is that all `plot_` functions apply the `all_grafify` colour scheme by default (see `plot_` vignettes on how to change colours)
2. two new types of graphs are possible with two quantitative X-Y plots with a third variable that is either numeric (`plot_xy_NumGroup`) or categorical (`plot_xy_CatGroup`).
3. there are two new continuous colour schemes (`scale_fill_grafify_c` and `scale_colour_grafify_c`), based on [Paul Tol's variant](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:sequential) of YlOrBl scheme.

# grafify v0.1.0
