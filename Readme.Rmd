### Installation

To install this package use the following steps. You'll need the package `remotes` installed first, skip to the second step if you already have it.

```{r installation, eval = F, include=T, message=F, warning=F}
install.packages("remotes") #install remotes
remotes::install_github("ashenoy-cmbi/grafify@*release") #install latest release 
```

I've noticed (personal experience) that if RStudio prompts you to update other packages while installing `grafify`, skipping that step (blank line or none) works best. Update other packages after installing `grafify` for smoother installation.

`grafify` also requires the following packages: `ggplot2`, `lmerTest`, `emmeans`, `car`, `pbkrtest`, `tidyr`, `purrr` and `Hmisc`.
 
### Motivation 

```{r, image-1hex, echo = F, out.width="150px"}
knitr::include_graphics("grafify.png")
```


The main goals of this package, besides making it easier for me to share data and functions for the statistics workshop, are the following:

1. easily make common types of graphs based on `ggplot2` but with fewer lines of code
2. carry out ANOVA analysis using linear models (`lm`) and mixed effects (`lmer`)
3. perform post-hoc comparisons (through `emmeans`) 
4. simulate one-way and two-way ANOVA design data for power analysis

### **Latest version: v1.5.0**

### Features

`grafify` has four main kinds of functions as follows.

1. There are 19 `plot_` functions of 6 broad types in `grafify`. The `plot_scatter..` versions are preferred when there are many data points, `plot_dot..` versions have a "cleaner" layout for smaller datasets. 

     a. Two categorical variables: these graphs either use scatter (or also called jitter) or dot plot geometries: `plot_scatterbar_sd`, `plot_scatterbox`, `plot_scatterviolin` and `plot_dotbar_sd`, `plot_dotbox`, `plot_dotviolin`
     **New in v1.5.0**: new `plot_` functions like the above but ending in `_sc` for *same colour* or *single colour* which plot boxes/dots/violins in one colour. This colour can be picked from `all_grafify` palettes or defined with a hexcode. 
     b. Three or four categorical variables: `plot_3d_scatterbar`, `plot_3d_scatterbox`, `plot_4d_scatterbar`, `plot_4d_scatterbox` 
     c. Quantitative X-Y & a third variable: `plot_xy_NumGroup`, `plot_xy_CatGroup` 
     d. Matched before-after graphs: `plot_befafter_colours`, `plot_befafter_shapes`
     e. Data distributions: `plot_qqline`, `plot_density` `plot_histogram`
     **New in v1.5.0**: `plot_qqmodel` which generates a Q-Q plot of standardised model residuals
     f. Summary graphs with SD error bars: `plot_bar_sd`, `plot_point_sd`
     **New in v1.5.0**: *single colour* versions of these available as names ending with `_sc`
  
  
```{r, all-graphs, echo = F, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("all_graphsv1.4.1.jpg")
```

The following qualitative and continuous palettes are implemented in `grafify`:


```{r, image-palettes, echo = F, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("grafify_palettesv0.2.0.jpg")
```

(The continuous colour scheme based on Paul Tol's [YlOrBl variant](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:sequential) is new in v0.2.0.)
  
2. Fitting linear models and linear mixed models and obtaining ANOVA tables

     a. linear models for ordinary ANOVAs: `simple_anova`, `simple_model`, 
     b. linear mixed effects ANOVAs: `mixed_anova`, `mixed_model`
  
3. Perform post-hoc comparisons based on fitted models
  
     a. `posthoc_Pariwise`
     b. `posthoc_Levelwise`
     c. `posthoc_vsRef`
  
4. Generating random one-way and two-way data based on mean and SD.

     a. one-way designs: `make_1way_data`, `make_1way_rb_data`
     b. two-way designs: `make_2way_data`, `make_2way_rb_data`

5. Colour-blind compatible schemes:
    a. `okabe_ito` (see Mike Mol's [blog](https://mikemol.github.io/technique/colorblind/2018/02/11/color-safe-palette.html)).
    b. `bright`, `pale`, `muted`, `dark`, `light`, `vibrant`, and `contrast`  colours (see Paul Tol's [blog](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:qualitative)).

### Release notes

Full reference to all functions available at [`grafify` pages](https://ashenoy-cmbi.github.io/grafify/index.html).

#### New in v1.5.0

1. New graph types

This version has 8 new `plot_` functions ending in `_sc` for plotting data with two variables wherein the X variable is plotted in a single colour. This contrasts existing versions that plot the X variable with multiple colours chosen from the `all_grafify` palette. This is convenient when there are too many groups on the X axis and multiple colours are not necessary.

2. Plotting Q-Q plot of model residuals

`plot_qqmodel` will plot a diagnostic Q-Q plot of a simple linear model (generated with `simple_model` or `lm`) or mixed effects linear model (generated with `mixed_model` or `lmer`) in a single step.

3. Minor fixes

Fixed a typo in `posthoc_Levelwise` where the `adjust` argument wasn not being correctly passed on to `emmeans`.


#### New in v1.4.1

This version "breaks" a few arguments from v0.3.1, therefore is v1.4.1. Specifically, opacity for both symbols and bars/boxes/violins can be set using `s_alpha` and `b_alpha` or `v_alpha`, respectively; previously, only bars/boxes/violin opacity could be set with a single `alpha` parameter. Old code with just `alpha` will no longer work, sorry! There are also new graph types and arguments for ANOVAs as below.

1. New graph types
   
    a. `plot_density` and `plot_histogram` for smooth density or histogram plots through `geom_density` and `geom_histogram` respectively.
    b. two new plot types `plot_scatterbox` and `plot_scatterviolin` that complement the `plot_dot...` versions and instead use `geom_point` with `position_jitter`. These versions are useful when a large number of data points are needed to be plotted.
    
1. Updates 

      a. `simple_anova` where the table also has Mean SS.
      b. `mixed_anova` now has two new arguments, one to change method for Df calculation and second to get type I or III SS (default is type II).
      c. `jitter` argument added to `plot_3d..` and `plot_4d..` functions for consistency with other scatter plots.
      d. `bwid` argument (for adjusting width of bars) added to `plot_scatterbar_sd` for consistency.

#### New in v0.3.1

Bug fixes in `mixed_model` and `simple_model` which now correctly lists the data used in the call field. 

#### New in v0.3.0

1. A new `plot_4d_scatterbar` function which is like `plot_4d_scatterbox` but plots bar and SD. So there are now two `plot_3d_` and `plot_4d_` functions.
2. Text on X-axis on all graphs can be rotated from 0-90 using `TextXAngle` argument to prevent overlap. 
3. `plot_dot_` functions now have `dotthick` option to set stroke thickness. This is similar to `symthick` for scatter/jitter plots.
4. Using `facet_wrap` or `facet_grid` will not draw a box around panel text (unlike the default in `theme_classic()`).
5. `plot_3d_` and `plot_4d_` functions draw symbols in black colour. 

#### Fixed in v0.2.1:

1. Bug fixes in `plot_3d_scatterbar` and `plot_3d_scatterbox`, which now correctly use the "shapes" variable to fill colour of bars/boxes and shape of the symbols; symbols are depicted in black.
2. `simple_anova` generates type II ANOVA table through `car::Anova()`, so the `car` package is now a dependency. v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 generated type I ANOVA table through `stats::anova()`. 

#### New in v0.2.0:

1. the main difference from v0.1.0 is that all `plot_` functions apply the `all_grafify` colour scheme by default (see `plot_` vignettes on how to change colours)
2. two new types of graphs are possible with two quantitative X-Y plots with a third variable that is either numeric (`plot_xy_NumGroup`) or categorical (`plot_xy_CatGroup`).
3. there are two new continuous colour schemes (`scale_fill_grafify_c` and `scale_colour_grafify_c`), based on [Paul Tol's variant](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:sequential) of YlOrBl scheme.
