\arguments{
\item{data}{a data table object, e.g. data.frame or tibble.}

\item{Y_value}{name of column containing quantitative (dependent) variable, provided within "quotes".}

\item{Fixed_Factor}{name(s) of categorical fixed factors (independent variables) provided as a vector if more than one or within "quotes".}

\item{Slopes_Factor}{name of factor to allow varying slopes on.}

\item{Random_Factor}{name(s) of random factors to allow random intercepts; to be provided as a vector when more than one or within "quotes".}

\item{Df_method}{method for calculating degrees of freedom. Default is Kenward-Roger, can be changed to "Satterthwaite".}

\item{SS_method}{type of sum of square, default is type II, can be changed to "I", "III", "1" or "2", or others.}

\description{
There are four related functions for mixed effects analyses: \code{mixed_model}, \code{mixed_anova}, \code{mixed_model_slopes}, and \code{mixed_anova_slopes}.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{\link[lmerTest]{lmer}} to fit a linear mixed effect model, passes on the model to \code{\link{anova}} and provides the ANOVA table.
It produces a type II sum of squares ANOVA table with Kenward-Roger approximation for degrees of freedom (as implemented in \code{lmerTest}) package.
It requires a data table, one dependent variable (Y_value), one or more independent variables (Fixed_Factor). Exactly one random factor (Random_Factor) and Slope_Factor should be provided.
This function is related to \code{\link{mixed_model}}.

More than one fixed factors can be provided as a vector (e.g. c("A", "B")). A full model with interaction term is fitted with one term each for varying slopes and intercepts.
This means when \code{Y_value = Y, Fixed_factor = c("A", "B"), Slopes_Factor = "S", Random_factor = "R"} are entered as arguments, these are passed on as \code{Y ~ A*B + (S|R)} (which is equivalent to \code{Y ~ A + B + A:B + (S|R)}).
In this experimental implementation, random slopes and intercepts are fitted (\code{(Slopes_Factor|Random_Factor)}). Only one term each is allowed for Â¬ and \code{Random_Factor}.
