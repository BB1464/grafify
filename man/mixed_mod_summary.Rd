\title{Mixed model summary from analyses of a model with random factors.}
\usage{
mixed_mod_summary(data, Y_value, Fixed_Factor, Random_Factor, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data table object, e.g. data.frame or tibble.}

\item{Y_value}{name of column containing quantitative (dependent) variable, provided within "quotes".}

\item{Fixed_Factor}{name(s) of categorical fixed factors (independent variables) provided as a vector if more than one or within "quotes".}

\item{Random_Factor}{name(s) of random factors to allow random intercepts; to be provided as a vector when more than one or within "quotes".}

\item{...}{any additional arguments to pass on to \code{\link[lmerTest]{lmer}}.}
}
\value{
This function returns the output of from \code{summary(lmerTest::lmer)}.
}
\description{
This function uses \code{\link[lmerTest]{lmer}} to fit a linear mixed effect model and provides the full \code{\link{summary}}. It requires a data table, one dependent variable (Y_value), one or more independent variables (Fixed_Factor), and at least one random factor (Random_Factor).
This function is related to \code{\link{mixed_model}} and \code{\link{mixed_anova}}.
}
\details{
When more than one fixed factors are entered in the argument, a full model with interaction term is fitted. This means when \code{Y_value = Y, Fixed_factor = c("A", "B"), Random_factor = "R"} are entered as arguments, these are passed on as \code{Y ~ A*B + (1|R)} (which is equivalent to \code{Y ~ A + B + A:B + (1|R)}).
For simplicity, only random intercepts are fitted (\code{(1|R)}). For factorial ANOVAs the default sum of squares is Type II and degrees of freedom are calculated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. All other settings are \code{\link[lmerTest]{lmer}} and \code{\link{anova}} defaults.
